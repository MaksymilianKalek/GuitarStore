# Maks's Guitar Store website

I do not own any of the media content used on this website

It's just a project for educational purposes

## What is it's usability?

- You can create and login into an account stored in an online database

- You can messages through the contact form that are stored in a local file on the server.

- You can add and remove products to/from your shopping cart

- You can checkout your order which will also be stored in a local file on the server
